<h1>Quiz Game With High Score</h1>

<h2>This repository includes a code related quiz with 5 questions, a timer, and a button to view the highscore page.</h2>
<br>

<p>The rules are simple:<br> 
There is a timer with a start of 75 seconds.<br> 
Answer the questions correctly to proceed to the next, and if you are wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.<br> 
Your score is based on how quickly and correctly you answer each, and is stored on the highscore page</p>

<br>

<p>An example of the game is shown below:<p>
